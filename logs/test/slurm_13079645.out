Ground Truth: IMPRESSION:  Suspicion of nondisplaced/minimally displaced nasal bone fractures with possible extension into nasal septum. Resulting mild soft tissue swelling at anterior nasal septum; consider correlation with physical exam to exclude nasal septal hematoma. No CT evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, large territory infarct, or intracranial mass. Scattered areas of white matter hypodensity; non-specific, but likely represent the sequela of age-related chronic microangiopathy.  No evidence of acute displaced fracture or traumatic malalignment of the cervical spine, thoracic, or lumbar spine. Multilevel degenerative changes including scattered endplate sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and intervertebral disc space narrowing. Ventral paraspinal confluent flowing bulky coarse osteophytes bridging multiple contiguous vertebral levels, suggestive of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.  No evidence of visceral, vascular, or osseous injury within the chest.  Similar appearing basilar predominant patchy peripheral and reticular groundglass airspace opacities, appearing slightly diminished in volume when compared to prior study compatible with sequela of history of COVID pneumonia.
